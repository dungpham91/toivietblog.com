# ribbon-lite-child theme for my old blog toivietblog.com

## 1. The story

This is the child theme source code that I previously coded for my old blog https://toivietblog.com.

In my career, there was a period around 2016-2017 when I did freelance work coding WordPress themes for small websites with low budgets, installing and operating websites for customers. Most are company introduction websites, some real estate websites and one fine art stone sales website.

Those websites all belong to customers and I cannot share anything about them, only my personal blog I can share information about.

I created the blog https://toivietblog.com a long time ago and wrote articles in Vietnamese, about the IT field I am working in. But my work was too busy to take care of it. My last post on that old blog was in 2021.

After that time, I started a new blog in English because I wanted to practice my English skills more at work, https://devopslite.com blog. This is my current blog and I have moved all the posts from my old blog over here.

I no longer use the theme I coded myself because I don't have time to maintain and update it.

So I'm sharing it on my github repo if anyone wants to refer or use it.

## 2. ribbon-lite-child theme

The child theme that I coded is based on the `ribbon-lite` theme, I don't know if that theme still exists on the wordpress.org repository anymore. So, I uploaded both theme folders to the repo.

Some features of child theme:

- Advertising blocks on the website, which only paid themes have. Otherwise you will have to use an ad insertion plugin and it can break your website. You can see the yellow blocks in the image below, which are the ad positions.

- Edit features and meta for some pages such as author, single post, comment...

- Add schema to the website based on http://schema.org standard. This helps the website have better SEO and almost no free themes have this feature.

- Minify and optimize js, css, html files to increase website loading speed.

- Supports Series Table of Contents plugin.
